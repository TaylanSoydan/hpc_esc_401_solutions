Ex1:
week5last.cpp is the c++ solution. it has a cpp extension.

Ex2:
ex2.cpp is the c++ solution.

-It means getting a pointer that contains the adress of that imaginary location. It causes undefined behavior and cause errors if the memory is segmented. Its behavior can change from compiler to compiler.

-p = pointer pointed at the first element of p..

-*p = value at the first element of p.

-&p = adress of the first element.

-*(p+1) = value at second element of p

-*p + 1 = pointer to the second element of p

-q[0] = p[ â€“ 1] is undefined , p[9], p[10] which is beyond memory so undefined behavior

-M is a pointer pointing to a pointer pointing to an integer. 

-*M is a pointer to the first slice of M.

-**M is a value, first element of the first slice of M.

-M[1][3] is 8.

-*(M[0]+1) is 1.

-*(*(M+1)+3) is 8.

-It depends, one is a value and other is an adress so they may or may not be the same.
