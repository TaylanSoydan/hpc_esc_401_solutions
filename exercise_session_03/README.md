# Exercise Session 03 #
In this session, you will work on modularization of the code and compilation optimization. Moreover, you will parallelize a simple code and successively plot its speedup. 

In this folder you can find:

* cpi.c : the serial version of last week parallel code, needed for Exercise 1
* cpi_mpi.c : the MPI version of cpi code, for Exercise 1
* sum.c : the code needed for Exercise 2 

Exercise 1:
Modify the serial version so that it includes your new module. Add instructions to the makefile to compile the new module and the new serial version.
cpi2.c is the modified serial version.
