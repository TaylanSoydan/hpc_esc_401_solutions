# Exercise Session 02 #
In this session, you will compile and run your first programs on Piz Daint. This directory contains two versions of the code that were parallelized using MPI or OpenMP.

My notes:
I used squeue -o "%A %u %p %a %j %D %.2t %r %S %L %p" for the customized output.

one failure I had was I assumed once I switched to gnu it would stay that way in my future logins but actually it reseted back to cray
